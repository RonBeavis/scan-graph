# scan-graph

scan_graph is a simple Python 3.0 project that shows how to pull a particular MS/MS scan out of a Thermo .raw file and generate an annotated graph for that scan, given an assigned peptide sequence.

There are two files:

1. scan_graph.py - contains methods used to extract a scan from a .raw file and to generate lists of annotation peaks

2. scan_graph_test.py - a demonstration of how to use the methods in scan_graph.py
